💻 Project Mockup Creation Guide
This guide details the steps for creating project screenshots displayed within a MacBook frame for a professional portfolio presentation.

Workflow
Preparation

Take a clean screenshot of the project screen/application.

Ensure you have the MacBook frame image inside assets/images.

Figma Process

Open Figma.

Drag and drop the MacBook frame image onto the canvas.

Drag and drop the project screenshot onto the canvas.

Adjust and Distort: Place the project screenshot over the MacBook screen area. Use Ctrl/Cmd + mouse drag (or the K key for the Scale tool, then Ctrl/Cmd to skew/distort corners if needed) to compress and fit the screenshot perfectly within the screen boundaries, matching the perspective.

Layer Ordering: Ensure the MacBook frame is positioned above the project screenshot in the layers panel to create the desired look (i.e., the screen frame overlays the content).

Group: Select both the screenshot and the MacBook frame, and press Ctrl/Cmd + G to group them. Rename the group to the specific project name (e.g., "Global Data Explorer Mockup").

Export: Select the newly created group and export it as a PNG file.

Image Optimization

Convert and Compress: Navigate to the TinyPNG website (or a similar optimizer like Squoosh).

Upload the exported PNG image.

Convert the image format to WebP for optimal web performance and smaller file size.

Download the optimized .webp file.

Integration

Add the final .webp image to your project's assets/images folder.
